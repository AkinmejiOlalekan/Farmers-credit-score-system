Core functionality for Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) calculations

This module provides the essential mathematical operations and logic required for
implementing the Analytic Hierarchy Process, a structured technique for organizing
and analyzing complex decisions.

The module includes functions for:
- Matrix normalization
- Consistency checking
- Score calculations
- Weight computations
